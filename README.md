# Caesar's Cipher
Caesar's Cipher is a single-page Angular web app for creating encrypted
messages to share with friends.

## Usage
When the page is initially loaded the subject & message areas are encrypted
by default. Clicking on the "Decrypt" button will make them legible.  Replace
the text with a message of your own, choose the character shift, and click
the "Encrypt" button.  You now have a coded message to puzzle your friends.
Enjoy!
