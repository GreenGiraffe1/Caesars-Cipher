    <p>Julius Caesar was a great general and politician, but he had many enemies. He encoded his communications to frustrate their spies. Caesar's method was so effective that it still bears his name. It obscures a message by shifting each letter by a secret number of characters. Though not secure today,  it continues to be used in online forums to hide spoilers and nsfw content from unintentional viewing. It's pattern is easily recognizable to computers, and can even be discerned with a keen eye. </p>
